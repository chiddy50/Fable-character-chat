# Next.js Fable Character Agent

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID="APP_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_SECRET="APP_SECRET"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://agents-api.doodles.app"
```

```bash

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install




npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

# Project Structure
You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family for Vercel.
